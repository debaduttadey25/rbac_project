# RBAC Admin Dashboard

This is an admin dashboard built with React to manage roles and users in a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. It allows the creation, updating, and editing of roles and users with associated permissions. The roles and users are stored in memory using React's `useState` hook and can be managed from the interface.

## Features

- **Roles Management**: Create and update roles with specific permissions.
- **Users Management**: Assign roles to users and update user information.
- **Editable Roles and Users**: Update existing roles and users with a simple form interface.
- **Context Management**: Use of React Context (`RoleContext`) to manage and share roles and users across components.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
